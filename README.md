Arduino Temperature controller for Son of Fermentation Chamber using a tip120 and Dallas temp sensor
This is a basic sketch for temperature control of a son of fermentation chamber using a tip120 to control a 12v fan and a dallas ds18b20 temperature sensor.  
This is a standalone sketch for the arduino with no data logging.

The main advantage of this sketch is it could be run entirely on battery if needed.
